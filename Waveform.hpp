		/*
			Because of the nature of the Waveform class, I'm most likely
			going to be removing the iterator functions from the library.

			The iterators will still be available from the containers
			themselves, of course, but because there is no obvious way
			to have just a "begin()" or "end()" function instead of
			"beginTime()" and "beginFreq()", and with there being no
			impact on performance either way, there is no good reason to
			keep the functions.

			Issues with not being able to mark "const" a function at the
			same time as checking the domain array validity (though there
			is a way to do it -- check in the function itself and throw an
			exception if the domain is not valid, but it's error prone and
			ugly) makes it difficult to consider this portion of the library
			intuitive or well-formed.

			The only reason iterators would be very useful is if they
			provided validation checks as well, but at the moment that
			portion of the library is not yet completed.

		//______________________________________________________________________
		//!	Validate and ensure that the specified domain is up-to-date
		/*!
		 *	This function is responsible for properly performing transforms
		 *	based on which domain(s) are valid as well as the domain which was
		 *	requested by the programmer.
		 *
		 *	As a reminder, DomainSpecifier is an enumeration which can be set
		 *	to one of 3 unique values: TimeDomain, FreqDomain, EitherDomain.
		 *
		 *	The variable validDomain_ maintains the current state of the system.
		 *	Each of the values of validDomain_ and their meaning are described
		 *	below:
		 *
		 *		TimeDomain		the time domain array timeSeries_ is valid,
		 *						while the contents of freqSpectrum_ should be
		 *						assumed to be out of date / invalid.
		 *
		 *		FreqDomain		the freq domain array freqSpectrum_ is valid,
		 *						while the contents of timeSeries_ should be
		 *						assumed to be out of date / invalid.
		 *
		 *		EitherDomain	this has to meanings, both of which ultimately
		 *						can be treated the same way:
		 *							1:	The last domain requested was done so
		 *								using one of the "Const" accessor
		 *								functions, so both of the domain arrays
		 *								may be read and modified from this
		 *								state.
		 *							2:	The Waveform was just constructed and
		 *								neither of the domain arrays contain
		 *								"useful" (useful to the user)
		 *								information. This means that either of
		 *								the domain arrays may be written to
		 *								without worrying about the validity of
		 *								the other domain. However, this also
		 *								means that neither of the domain arrays
		 *								can be read to provide valid data, but
		 *								since the user just initialized the
		 *								object they should be aware in any
		 *								circumstance that the arrays contain
		 *								only garbage.
		 *
		 *	The function parameter toValidate can take on those same three
		 *	values, this time with slightly different meanings:
		 *
		 *		TimeDomain		the time domain array was requested and
		 *						transforms should be performed as needed in
		 *						order to validate the domain.
		 *
		 *		FreqDomain		the freq domain array was requested and
		 *						transforms should be performed as needed in
		 *						order to validate the domain.
		 *
		 *		EitherDomain	the request for one of the domain arrays was
		 *						of the "Const" variety, so no matter which
		 *						domain the user wanted, both domain arrays
		 *						will be valid after the call. Using
		 *						EitherDomain like this allows the
		 *						implementation to be much simpler.
		 *
		 *	Because this is the core mechanism of the library, it's important
		 *	to note that the use of EitherDomain like this is fundamentally
		 *	reliant on the transform class used for the Waveform classes'
		 *	template parameter TransformT <em>providing two functions which
		 *	(along with the dataset) form a group (by the definition of group
		 *	theory)</em>. This means that the transform \f$\mathcal{F}\f$ and its
		 *	inverse \f$\mathcal{F}^{-1}\f$ must be unitary -- that is, they must
		 *	satisfy the composition criteria
		 *
		 *		\f$\mathcal{F}^{-1} \circ \mathcal{F} (x) = id (x)\f$ 
		 *	
		 *	(which is of course the definition of an inverse function!)
		 *	
		 *	This may seem obvious given the mathematical definition of, say,
		 *	the Fourier transform, but one of the most popular implementations,
		 *	FFTW3 (http://www.fftw.org), does not provide real-to-complex
		 *	forward- and inverse-transform functions which are true inverses of
		 *	the other -- the inverse transform of the "...dft_r2c_1d" transform
		 *	function is the "...dft_c2r_1d" function which results in a scaled
		 *	inverse. These transforms could be called "scaled unitary" or,
		 *	but must be rescaled in order to function properly in this library.
		 *
		 *	You can use transforms which are involutary functions (such as the
		 *	Laplace transform) by defining both "exec_transform()" and
		 *	"exec_inverse_transform()" (both are required functions of a
		 *	compatible TransformT class) to simply call the same function for
		 *	both.

		 *
		 *	In the event that swap was not specialized for
